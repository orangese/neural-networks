# neural-networks
Contains code, databases, and weights/biases for various ANNs.

Note: for those working on the Blockstack project with me, go to "credit_analysis" -> "new" -> "credit_analysis_code" for the machine learning code, and go to "credit_analysis" -> "new" -> "credit_analysis_dataset" for the dataset.
